# WorkLogger  
Personal work logger.  
I haven't gotten a proper use for it yet but I built - and run - it for the possibility of auditing the tasks I perform and how long I spend on them. I am running this from startup on "all users" on my Windows computers - and I am the primary (99%) user of each computer. 
  
Usage:  
* Runs on computer, looping every 4 seconds (customisable) to check what window I am using and recording that window in memory. If it is a new window it will record to the log. If it is the same as the previous window it will sleep 4 seconds then renew the loop.  
  
Software Required:  
* AutoHotKey (freely downloadable from the Internet)
